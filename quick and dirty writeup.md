First off, I just wanna say this is a quick and dirty introduction to what i've been cooking, and that "dish" is eristocrates: A bit of an ADHD pun with key and maybe a Hands Down reference with HD? I'm beyond stoked to finally unveil this. I've been wanting to interact more in the community but I didn't wanna keep being cryptic to nice ppl like u/0nikoroshi who understandably want more details. I think at first i dreamed of the perfect debut writeup/blog post after all the bugs were ironed out but we all know that's a pipe dream. I wanna chat with y'all nerds now. So! View eristocrates as a "living codebase": far from "complete" but I think i'm comfortable sharing what i've got so far anyways. You know what they say, perfect is the enemy of the good and allat. I have far too many ideas and too much to say, but i'll leave that to the eventual actual blog in my planned small website. For now, I just wanna give back to the community that has given me so much, y'all are the reason i still use reddit fr fr.

I've been lurking around here since 2020ish? While I was always curious about keyboards, I fell down the alt keyboard layout rabbit hole proper after watching pinguefy's [excellent vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2Nb9QVujgU) on him learning a new one. It's funny, pinguefy's [other vid on dactyls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XScUYxLFt-U) is what sent me down the ergo keep rabbit hole too, but I'll get to that next paragraph. I'm gonna try to keep this write up brief (emphasis on try), just enough for context at how I arrived at eristocrates. I got a [Drop CTRL](https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard) with the tactile clear switches back in 2020 (although they were Massdrop back then) and set out to find an alt layout for me. One thing you'll learn about me quickly is I'm not the type to *blindly* follow convention, I much prefer exploration. I know this is a red flag for contrarian activities, but I just like things that are perfect for me, and that happens to be stuff nobody has heard of. Plus the only way to self discover what's perfect for me is to explore beyond what's out there on the surface, beyond what's popular.  So I explored! I looked into as much as i could find, dvorak, colemak and dh, workman, carpalx, and more. That led me to an alt layout i've literally never heard anybody else mention, [ThinQu](https://microexploitation.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/thinqu/). To this day I don't know how i found it. If i had to guess i was probably searching something about optimized layouts. You know that bit about workman and [the rhetorical skill of the creator](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1eqyfij/space_to_the_home_row_on_a_40_kb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)? I think this was my version of that. I didn't "fall" for carpalx, nor workman, but [ThinQu's writeup](https://microexploitation.wordpress.com/2018/06/26/the-development-of-the-thinqu-keyboard-layout-factors-that-influence-typing-effort/) spoke to me in a way nothing else did. It's funny, it's essentially just a more obscure version of the same argument, trying to have a more involved effort consideration than workman itself. As for things that really spoke to me, I liked the consideration of alternation and the dedicated bigram keys. I had never realized typing could be analyzed like that, nor that keyboards could be customized to that degree. Thankfully I was already on the comp sci degree path, so I was quite comfortable jumping into programming firmware. I got my CTRL, setup QMK and tweaked the programmer variant of ThinQu [further to my liking](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/9e3e46e74ccff34ca870867f70771acd). I've been typing on it to this very sentence (more on that later). I think my wpm peaked at around 80ish when i was actually trying? Although my main priority was never speed (it's nice to have ofc). I just wanted something more ergonomic, or put another way, comfortable to type on.

It wasn't until 2 years later, that aforementioned pinguefy dactyl vid came out and I realized there was more comfort to be had outside of base alpha considerations. I had some familiarity with ergo keebs, but nothing to the degree of dactyls. I spent the next couple years consuming ergo keeb content, watching tons of great yt vids on the topic, and plotting and scheming a way to get my hands onto an ergo keeb. Another important context for my decision making was of course budget. I'm not gonna divulge bank statements, but let's just say to me it's worth making minimum payments on debts for a short while if it means making a majorly impactful quality of life improvement. A good portion of that time was spent taste making, and then realizing the price point of my nascent tastes was not gonna be cheap. I was actually quite obsessed with u/tenstaana 's [ScyllaBallz](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/za7qgu/scyllaballz_rev2/) and thought somehow I was gonna be able to reverse engineer it on my own (the height of folly). I mentioned my comp sci degree, but I'm otherwise quite ignorant when it comes to making hardware. Most i've ever soldered was some connections in my bass guitar. Not to mention the upfront money cost of a 3d printer and time cost of learning electronics. Needless to say, eventually reality comes crashing in and i realize i'm just gonna have to buy the closest prebuilt to the scyllaballz available: u/balanstik 's [Charybdis](https://bastardkb.com/product/charybdis-prebuilt-preorder-2/).

By this point i had decided on 3x6 physical layout, so the Charybdis Mini was the flavor for me. I know chopping the extra pinky row is popular, but for me having 1 key away from home row on all sides just makes sense. I'd be lying if i didn't admit that it's partly just a weird hangup about symmetry/aesthetics, but I do find usage even on my outer column so it's perfect for me. So for my birthday 2024, I finally save up/ask friends to pitch in for my gift, choose [crystal jades](https://www.thockking.com/products/kailh-box-jade-crystal-clicky-switches) for clickmaxxing, spent ALTOGETHER WAY TOO LONG finding [a pom jelly look alike in dsa profile](https://ymdkey.com/products/dsa-1u-transparent-blank-keycaps-abs?variant=39814853820477), place my order and no more than 5 weeks later I finally have the keeb. Now for the familiar question of what layout to use.....

You may be asking why not just "port" ThinQu to split/column stagger? By this point I was lurking around on this sub and the [Alt Keyboard Layout Discord](https://discord.gg/WGzwtEW2) and had already seen the more modern "post colemak" layouts. I even finally educated myself on keyboard layout theory [(read the friendly manual!!!)](https://bit.ly/layout-doc-v2). Empowered with terminology and community to bounce ideas off of in the discord specifically, I realized there were definitely problems. Problems I can now articulate! bro was NOT considering columns or sfb avoidance when he designed this. S is subpar as a partner to L but acceptable, but in the case of LSM it just adds too much SFS and SFBs. fairly common bigrams like OH, IK, AP, AF, AY, CR, VR, LS, SM are all SFBs. There's prob even more, but when you get to a layout with features like dedicated bigram keys it's hard to analyze.  there's really no analyzer out there that accounts for features like that.  that led me to looking at more and more layouts. I was drawn to Engram early on, but there's always somebody that pops in on [any engram post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/s/8ytUOSyLbz) saying it forces work onto the pinkies. Not that they're wrong, but I guess i'm not bothered by that? I'm a Bass Guitarist and an avid rhythm gamer and my pinkies are already quite used to being active in games like [Beatmania IIDX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwfZCT9kGIQ). I guess, similar to me liking 3x6 for aesthetic reasons, there was something quite appealing to the inner column not having any alpha keys. I never forgot my interest with engram, and u/sunaku 's [engrammer layourt](https://sunaku.github.io/engrammer-keyboard-layout.html) was great but very tailored to his glove80, which actually inspired me to tailor something specifically for myself too. So I continued looking for a new layout to adopt. By this point, I think I also began to notice another of my big priorities: firmware level features. People always talk about ["cognitive load"](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1e39qrr/multicharacter_tricks/) but as far as i'm concerned my "cognitive tolerance" is quite high! In fact, if it's for exploration i'm willing to take on probably more cognitive load than anybody reasonably should lmao. When it comes to layouts specifically with firmware features in mind it started with coming across [magic sturdy](https://github.com/Ikcelaks/keyboard_layouts/blob/main/magic_sturdy/magic_sturdy.md) and eventually led to me finding u/phbonachi 's [Hands Down](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown). But if you recall from when i last chose ThinQu, I just had to further tweak it to my personal liking. And thankfully, Hands Down already embraces layout variations. I knew liked Engram's center column idea quite a bit, and [Hands down is even easy on the pinkies](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/design-notes?authuser=0) which should counter the oft cited pinky load center symbol columns causes. so why not hand roll a Hands Down layout variant on my own?  Thus, the spark for eristocrates was born.

First, a quickish rundown of layout considerations. I'll save firmware considerations for later, but do keep in mind all decisions were made with firmware features in mind.  I know there are a lot of ppl that want layouts where magic isn't "needed" to "fix" it. To each their own ofc, but why learn keyboard magic and not spell? One more thing to know about me is that I'm not the type to place too much weight on analyzers. I know just how subjective any software is, and not to sound accusatory, but anybody can "cook the books" if you just know what parameters to showcase. Not to mention many analyzers fail to include parameters i'm interested in, like firmware features. Let's just say I take analyzers as a bonus to my considerations but not gospel. With that said, let's cover what I love about hands down from a layout perspective. The first big thing was Thumb alphas! With an ergo keeb I could finally explore thumb alphas. Hands down gold had a T on thumb, yet Hands Down Titanium had R on thumb. It occurred to me that in all of my research, not once had I ever seen 2 thumb alphas. As i'm sure you could guess about me by now, there's a sort of aesthetic symmetry to a thumb on both alphas that was too irresistible to resist. If any of what i'm about to say sounds esoteric this is yet another reminder to read the friendly manual's [How to make a layout section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.h0x0jtd0x2wk). I won't spend too much time on every column or anything, but it really helps to understand why i made the decisions i did. Like having opinions on columns is probably one of my favorite things about the layout doc i wish it was mandatory reading because so many people's "[what](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1es081r/help_me_choose_a_layout/) [layout](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/16z6f4f/how_to_choose_between_layout_a_and_b/) [should](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1dfcj90/some_help_choosing_a_new_layout/) [i](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/wh3uf0/cant_choose_between_colemak_and_carpalx_qgmlwb/) [choose](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/16zw8ry/i_can_not_choose_layout/)" posts would be solved if they could just form their own opinion. I digress.

Informed by the layout doc, I chose R on the consonant hand and T on the vowel hand. Both of those have a major impact, as T and R are 2 of the high frequency consonants that must be taken into consideration when designing [letter stacks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.fkc9oxga9jo9). [R is the letter with the worst pairings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.7aymtu9cb7e6), so honestly getting it away from the other alphas is a boon. I'm in agreement with Hands Down on [why T not E](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/hands-down-neu?authuser=0#h.8i2msuo3butx) too, yet gold and titanium split these two choices up. [¿Porque no los dos?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqgSO8_cRio) From a layout perspective, this is probably the biggest innovation of eristocrates. All columns i've ever seen assumed at most one thumb alpha, but with T and R freed, I have a flexibility of columns & [consonant patterns](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.q325im3vopng) most people don't, like *I literally don't have a consonant stack*. So I'm already in territory unaccounted for in the layout doc, a single [EO vowel stack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.t6uvolgxb6bi) with [C on index](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.v9934ovpm7v). I lifted index PDC from hands down gold, but it's still good to understand why i kept it.  I do quite like inward rolling, so [UA OE YI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.t6uvolgxb6bi) was good for me to keep as well. I'll get to it in the firmware section, but i solve my EO stack with sfs/sfbs with firmware features. i'm still working on punctuation under the vowel block, but like most things, i address some of it with [firmware.As](http://firmware.As) a programmer, braces are pretty important, and it seems like a good fit so far next to comma/period.  I also noticed that Hands down already has one column of just symbols, so it wasn't too hard to move the other letters off that remaining column to have an engram style inner column devoid of alphas.  For consonants, It's mostly hands down gold with the VKW inner column from titanium moved to the pinky. This is where my penchant for pinky columns kicks in, as i was able to move the least used consonants outwards to create XJ and ZQU (qu on tap, q on linger, more in firmware section bout that). This is also more territory uncovered by the doc, as it assumes a layout [without HN, HR, or RN](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.26oc0mqwptjr) will necessarily have a CS column. I'm not too sure what category i fall under... I do have [N & H on separate hands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.w96cbsi9t3bg) for rolling, my [H is on my vowel hand](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.jj11ohf7figd) for alternation, I also have  I'll also mention that i have two spacebars! by now i'm sure you get my preference for symmetry, but also it solves [space thumb optimization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic-h8UxGe5-Q0bPuYNgE3NoWiI8ekeadvSQ5YysrwII/edit#heading=h.f57erm13v910) as i can always pick whatever thumb would be "optimal". my general go to is, if the preceding key was on a hand, use the space for that hand for the inward roll. yet again, any edge cases are handled with firmware features.

Firmware firmware firmware! can't even get through the layout section without mentioning firmware. Firmware wise, The biggest draw to Hands Down was the attitude of fully [embracing the potential of firmware features](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home#h.il8zbx3zs8ux). Home row mods, combo shortcuts, adaptive, linger & semantic keys, I was like a kid in [the second single by rapper 50 Cent from his second commercial album, The Massacre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRcnnId15BA). Let me cover the aforementioned firmware features from last paragraph, then I'll do a lightning round of what i've got implemented cause whew lawd this post gettin long. I solve my EO stack, or honestly every sfb, with my expansion to u/empressabyss 's [Arcane Keys](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1ed931s/nordrassil_layout_update_also_im_naming_my/). TL;DR it's a hybrid magic/repeat key. if the key that came before is on the same hand as the arcane key, it's a repeat. if the key that came before is on the opposite hand as the arcane key, it's magic. It's funny, I was planning a similar feature called a coda key, referencing [coda's relationship to repeat in a music theory context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J94ic1N1xgU) but empressabyss beat me to it so they get to name it. My first change from empressabyss' version is that mine aren't thumb keys. My thumb alphas were spoken for, but I did just free up some primo real estate in those inner columns so i put mine there. At first i just had the center key on each side as an arcane key, but after i saw [somebody asking if they were crazy if they tried a third magic key](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1eh29l8/am_i_crazy_if_i_try_a_third_magic_key/) i realized that I was quite crazy in fact and should put arcane keys on **every inner column**. So I'm gonna coin a technique that eliminates all my sfbs with arcane keys called: Arcane Columns. This might be hard to parse in text, but essentially every magic function of an key is a letter in the preceding key's column. Let's pick that EO sfb for example. I hit E, then I hit the *top left arcane key for O*. You might be thinking, wait isn't that \*? I also lifted the adaptive roll concept from hands down so that top left arcane is \* by default, but quickly pressing it after E outputs O as magic. the same top left arcane key would repeat, like P top left arcane is PP, M top left arcane is MM, you get it. Notably I solve thumb alpha + space sfbs(stbs? for same thumb bigrams?) as left space left home arcane outputs R, not a repeated space. This is so configurable and powerful I even eliminated my grody BI pinky ring scissor by having B home right arcane output BI. The sky's the limit, but for now i'm just slowly adding any case while i come across it. my punctuation has a lot baked into it too! I piggybacked all of those arcane developments to make my own version of [adaptive comma](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/s/MSx1y5bhMl) and u/delatorrejuanchi 's' [adaptive period](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1cc2yri/comment/l12n0qr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for me they output one shot shift and capsword respectively. For my parentheses i added this amazing [caret repositioning feature from Lean Rada aka Kalabasa](https://leanrada.com/notes/my-personalised-keyboard/) which i really wanna rebrand as roll reversal. I also haven't fully figured out home row mods yet (i'm quite interested in u/stasmarkin 's [implementation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1f18d8h/i_have_fixed_home_row_mods_in_qmk_for_everyone/?chainedPosts=t3_rxs308)) but I did add callum one shots on the SML and SMR layers. I have multiple features from u/pgetreuer 's amazing blog, too many to count now because this little quick and dirty writeup has ballooned to an elephantine and filthy write up. oh geez i really gotta kick in that lightning round huh.

I invented a dedicated vim system based on fighting game motion inputs called Vim Fighter. Yea i know kind of a bombshell to drop for a lightning round but thankfully i at least have [my movelist](https://github.com/eristocrates/bkqmk/blob/main/vimFighter.md) automated to generate so you can take a peek at that if you're curious. the word count on this post (and the rent) is too damn high but i'd love to made a dedicated post on vim fighter once it's cleaned up. I implemented and expanded andrewjrae's [qmk-vim](https://github.com/andrewjrae/qmk-vim) and toggle all my vim commands between a genuine vim environment or emulating with qmk-vim with that right bottom outer key. Since i don't have a screen, (my one hardware regret with the charybdis) I track these states via a 5 point rgb color scheme I made in no small part thanks to the legendary drashna's code examples. I toggle a lot of things with the core leader key feature, but i'm prob gonna try that [timeless leader key also by andrewjrae](https://github.com/andrewjrae/kyria-keymap?tab=readme-ov-file#userspace-leader-sequences). one thing i toggle is [Lean Rada's bitwise input method](https://leanrada.com/notes/developing-bitwise-input-method/) for lightning fast number input from 0 to 31. His was only for function keys F1 through F15, but i took that, expended it to F1-F24, then realized i might as well just add actual numbers 0-31. There's STILL more i've probably done by now, and so much beyond that i just have on a list, but quite honestly this gotta get wrapped up. if you made it this far, holy shit thank you so much. It's funny, even writing this post touches upon the one regret i have so far with doing all of this: ***the time load***. I think my brain can handle cognitive load, but the time it takes to pioneer being as goofy with magic rocks as i can is immense. This has all been in one month for me, and unfortunately I can't put aside all my other projects, obligations and deadlines for another straight month to procrastinate resolving bugs by add more firmware features in. My "to try" list is immense, but it can (and should!) always increase. If you have any ideas at all that you'd be curious if someone else would try please send them my way. if you'd ever want more detail on something i only touched upon, send your questions my way as well. I'm gonna have to relegate keyboard time only to the weekends at least until i clear some of these deadlines, but I'd love to finally get some feedback and even more ideas from this wonderful community.

Absolutely lastly, some links. you can find [my mess of a repo here](https://github.com/eristocrates/bkqmk) and [all my layers too](https://github.com/eristocrates/bkqmk/blob/main/keyboards/bastardkb/charybdis/3x6/keymaps/eristocrates/keymap.svg). It's not quite at the level i'd like it to be, but IRL comes first ya know? I look forward to a well maintained codebase someday soon. Until then just ask me anything and i'll do my best to help, and i look forward to feedback and discussion. I'm off to get groceries so i don't starve this week. if only i could subsist off of firmware....
